# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is a simulation of an etch-a-sketch. You can add drawing to the canvas by hovering over it with your mouse cursor. There is a button to change the size of the "pixels" by changing the dimensions of the canvas. There are also options to change between a black and white drawing and a colored one. The color option uses a randomized color when you hover over the canvas and increases the opacity by 10% each time you hover over a pixel already colored. 

This program demonstrates an understanding of basic HTML and CSS, as well as flexbox, and JavaScript DOM manipulation concepts involving targeting existing elements, creating new nodes, editing them, and adding them to the DOM, as well as adding eventListeners.
